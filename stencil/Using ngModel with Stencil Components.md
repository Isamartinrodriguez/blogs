# Using ngModel with Stencil Components

[Stencil](https://stenciljs.com) is a tool for building modern Web Components. Stencil combines some of the best features from traditional frameworks, but outputs 100% standards-compliant Custom Elements, part of the Web Component spec. The Web Component collections created with Stencil can then be used in projects that use any application framework, including no framework at all.

This article explains how to integrate your Web Components into forms on [Angular](https://angular.io) projects using [Control Value Accessors](https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor). A control value accessor is an interface that acts as a bridge between your component and the Angular forms API, allowing you to use ngModel, form validation, and the like with your component.
